Welcome to the UN Photo Club, a community of photography enthusiasts located in the Vienna International Centre! Our non-profit association is dedicated to helping our members explore the many facets of photography, from thematic discussions and seminars to workshops and field activities, as well as excursions to places of interest. Our goal is to promote the creative potential of our members and provide access to modern equipment for collective use, including computers, digital tools, lighting gear, and more.

We maintain close contact with other photo clubs and encourage our members to participate in Austrian and international photo contests. Additionally, our Club maintains a library of photographic books and magazines to inspire and inform our members. Come join us and share your passion for photography with like-minded individuals!
